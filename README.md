Kash Development
================

This is an archive of the Kash Development website. (July 2014)

I created this website in September 2010 and have continued to maintain it until July 2014.

Kash Development, LLC is a family-owned business that provides rental homes in East Lansing, Michigan. The purpose of this website is to make it easy for people to locate the properties and find out information about them. I decided to add all of the properties to a Google map, so potential renters can locate them easily and get directions if necessary. I also created a photo album and an information list for each property. The website also features downloadable lease documents and a conveniently placed phone number in the header.
